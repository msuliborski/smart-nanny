# Smart Nanny
Device that monitors  baby's activity and send data to the receiver device with the display. Embedded Systems (2018)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
In order to properly build application one might need following devices:
* 2 x Arduino - Uno R3,
* 2 x Wireless Radio Module - nRF24L01,
* 1 x LCD KeyPad Shield,
* 1 x Temperature and Humidity Sensor - DHT11,
* 1 x RTC - DS1307,
* 1 x Sound Sensor Module - VM309
* 1 x Piezo buzzer
In addition one might need Arduino IDE.

### Cloning
```
$ git clone https://github.com/msuliborski/smart-nanny
```

### Building
Simply use Arduino IDE to build and deploy programs onto the boards

### Usage
Turn on both devices and they should work with no further cofiguration

## Built with
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) - open-source Arduino IDE making it easy to write code and upload it to the board.
